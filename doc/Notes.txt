General Notes:
-Added test data via fixtures for all models. Special attention should be paid to testing in the 'checks' model since this defines the relationshio between event, attendee and item.
-Item type is not currently used and added to future version ideas.


FUTURE VERSION IDEAS

-Station Based Security (Authorized access)
-Change tracking (Track user edits to objects not just created_by and updated_at)
-Support multiple codes for items and users with validation. (Example: 6 digit integer only or UPC code exclusion) Helps prevent scanning in correct codes.
-Second Factor authentication and/or SQRL login.
-Item type support.
